terminus-project
================
Terminus is an integrated development environment to create regular expression (also known als "Regex") in an easy way.
Core features are the syntax highlighting, tabbed working, an library for often used phrases and much more.

State
================
Terminus is still in an early state and it is not stable at the moment. Forking at the current state is not recommended, because I will change
a lot more things on the sourcecode, also some features are still buggy

License
================
Terminus is/ will be licensed under the terms and conditions of the LGPL v3.
