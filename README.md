terminus-project
================
Terminus is an integrated development environment to create regular expression (also known als "Regex") in an easy way.
Core features are the syntax highlighting, tabbed working, an library for often used phrases and much more. Also it will be possible to:
- Export the data to *.csv, *.html and blank text (*.txt)
- "Rescue" of changed phrases
- A "pool" of often used phrases
- Usage on Windows, Linux and Mac
- A plugin System
- User edited Color Shemes
- Multilanguage
- Restore accidently deleted phrases

State
================
Terminus is still in an early state and it is not stable at the moment. Forking at the current state is not recommended, because I will change
a lot more things on the sourcecode, also some features are still buggy.
